# Project 9: Honeypots

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

> Objective: Set up and use a Honeypot virtual machine.

Which Honeypot(s) you deployed:
  * I deployed dionaea with http, wordpot, glastopf, and conpot.
  
Any issues you encountered:
  * The biggest issue I encounter was with Google Cloud services.  Starting a new project was returning an 'unknown error'.  I decided to use my Digital Ocean account to set up a MHN VM.  I had no issues after installing MHN.  Installing and delpoying the honeypots was simple and straightforward.
  
A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.:
  * After over 72 hours of the honeypot being active, only one recorded attack has happened.
  * Country: Switzerland
  * Port 5060
  * Protocol: SipSession (a voice and video call application in private phone networks)
  * Target: dionaea
